    "paragraph": "Pre-malignant tissue can have a distinctive appearance under the microscope. Among the distinguishing traits of a pre-malignant lesion are an increased number of dividing cells, variation in nuclear size and shape, variation in cell size and shape, loss of specialized cell features, and loss of normal tissue organization.."

    "paragraph": "Many different lifestyle factors contribute to increasing cancer risk. Together, diet and obesity are related to approximately 30â€“35% of cancer deaths.[8][30] Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and avoidance of processed meat, red meat, animal fats, and refined carbohydrates.[31] The evidence to support these dietary changes is not definitive."

    "paragraph": "Cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor."

    "paragraph": "Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable."
